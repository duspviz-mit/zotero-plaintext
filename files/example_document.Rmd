Bruno Latour has argued that the cynical, conspiratorial sensibilities that have long permeated the critical tradition have limited
the remit of our scholarship and prevented us from assembling publics around matters of concern [@latour_why_2004].

>"While there may be general agreement about the integral value of critique to scienti!c and intellectual enterprises, less attention has been paid to the form and delivery of critique." [@schuurman_care_2002, 291]
